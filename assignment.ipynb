    "# Hands-On Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Module 2, machine learning is about optimizing over a loss.\n",
    "How well a machine learning model performs depends on both the hypothesis and loss function that we choose to use.\n",
    "This general framework goes under the name of *[empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will walk you through the basic steps of empirical risk minimization: the optimization problem at the heart of most modern-day machine learning systems.\n",
    "We will use a simple motivating example for an end-to-end demonstration: predicting whether a patient with a given antigen test value is infected with Covid-19.\n",
    "Using the same synthetic Covid-19 dataset you worked with in Hands-On Assignment 1,\n",
    "we will train a simple [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)\n",
    "which predicts that an individual is infected with Covid-19 if and only if their test value is above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we will take a break from the serious stuff and learn about regular expression\n",
    "(or review regular expressions if you are already familiar).\n",
    "Regular expressions are a tool that you will almost certainly find useful for your entire CS career,\n",
    "and is especially useful when working with data (as you will be doing a lot).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. We will first set up a basic empirical risk minimization problem.\n",
    "2. Next, we will find a hypothesis that results in a small loss.\n",
    "3. Then, we will evaluate our solution and the associated risks of deployment.\n",
    "4. Finally, we will learn about all the core features of regular expressions."

    "## Part 1: Setting up the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will setup the empirical risk minimization problem we wish to solve, by:\n",
    " - Defining our variables of interest.\n",
    " - Choosing a \"hypothesis class\" $ \\mathcal{H} $, or space of possible solutions, that we will search.\n",
    " - Selecting a \"loss function\" $ L $ that will be minimized by our learned solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is about trying to come up with a function (usually called a *hypothesis*) that can make correct predictions as often as possible.\n",
    "The more our hypothesis is correct, the lower the *risk* of that hypothesis.\n",
    "A hypothesis that is always correct has zero risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real life, it's almost always impossible to make something that is always correct.\n",
    "(If we could, there would be no point in machine learning.)\n",
    "It's also impossible for us to always know when our hypothesis is right or wrong\n",
    "(imagine trying to predict something for every person in the world (past, present, and future)).\n",
    "We may know how our hypothesis performs on our small dataset,\n",
    "but we can't know how it will perform on all possible data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "So since we can't compute the true risk of a hypothesis, we instead approximate it by computing an *empirical risk*.\n",
    "To do this, we narrow down our set of data points from every possible data point to a known set of data (called our \"training data\").\n",
    "We can then compute our average loss over our training data to compute our empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - Mathematical Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's put our intuition from the previous section into math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is the **minimization** (over several possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $) of the expected loss (i.e. *risk*) of a hypothesis $ h $ with the data $ Z $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\mathbb{E}_Z \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So we want to select one hypothesis $ h $ from our set of possible hypotheses $ \\mathcal{H} $\n",
    "that minimizes the loss (risk) we expect to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are taking the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) ($ \\mathbb{E} $) over all possible values of the data.\n",
    "If you haven’t seen expectation before, we will discuss it in detail in a future module.\n",
    "But for now, you can think of expectation as the average value we would get if we randomly sampled infinite data points.\n",
    "For example, if we fairly picked random numbers between 1 and 99 (inclusive),\n",
    "then the expected value (expectation) would be 50.\n",
    "You can make a small Python program to try it out yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our training data $ Z = \\{z_1, z_2, z_3, ..., z_N \\} $, we can say that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N L(z_i, h)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This may look intimidating,\n",
    "but remember that $ L(z_i, h) $ is just a function that produces a single number.\n",
    "So if we say that our loss for the ith data point is $ L(z_i, h) = l_i $,\n",
    "then our equation looks like:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ l \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N l_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which we can see is just an average.\n",
    "So the key takeaway here is that the expectation is just an average over possible outcomes\n",
    "(in this case each data point is one possible outcome)."

    "### Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python for this exercise (hence the iPython notebook),\n",
    "so we will be using the `re` Python standard library.\n",
    "Almost every major programming language has regular expressions either built-in directly or supported in a standard library.\n",
    "There may be slight variations in the syntax and semantics from language to language,\n",
    "but the core functionality will all be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### re.search()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment (and probably most of your Python regex usage),\n",
    "we will be using the method `re.search()`.\n",
    "`re.search()` takes two required arguments,\n",
    "first the regex and then the string to search in (we will often call this the \"target\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another method `re.match()` that is subtly different,\n",
    "and you will probably want to avoid.\n",
    "`re.search()` looks for a match within a string (and it can be the entire string).\n",
    "`re.match()` tries to match **the beginning** of a string (and that can mean the entire string).\n",
    "Later in this assignment, we will discuss how to recreate the functionality of `re.match()`\n",
    "in a more explicit and less error-pone way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Normal\" Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "The most simple regular expressions can be used to match strings in the same way that you would use another string to match a string\n",
    "(like if you were using [`str.find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find) or [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace)).\n",
    "Just type the characters that you want to match.\n",
    "In fact, in Python strings are used to represent regular expressions.\n",
    "So most strings are already regular expressions\n",
    "(but arbitrary strings may contain special symbols which are not valid regular expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the string `\"foo\"` can be used as a regular expression to match \"foo\", \"food\", \"foo bar\",\n",
    "and literally infinite other strings that have “foo” as a substring."
